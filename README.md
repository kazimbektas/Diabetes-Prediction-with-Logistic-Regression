# Diabetes-Prediction-with-Logistic-Regression

## 1 Business Problem
Developing a machine learning model to predict whether individuals have diabetes based on their features.

## 2 Dataset Story
The dataset is sourced from a larger dataset maintained by the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases** in the United States. This specific dataset focuses on a study of **Pima Indian women** aged 21 and above living in **Phoenix, Arizona**. The target variable, `Outcome`, represents whether an individual has tested positive for diabetes (1) or negative (0).

## 2.1 Dataset Variables
- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Diabetes test result (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
